Now it's starting to get interesting, and our robots are taking shape.

This workshop we'll start following a ball, and introduce the next tool in our toolbox - The `while` loop!

We're also moving through another, more complicated maze:

<div markdown="1" style="text-align: center">
  ![test2](/assets/img/mazeTask2.gif){: width="70%"}
</div>
</div>

## What are they and why do we need them?

While conditionals have allowed us to make code that reacts to its environment, we were still somewhat limited. For example, in the maze workshop from last week, your solution likely just copy/pasted the same code three times over, to clear the 3 gates.

Coming back to the cooking recipe, you are often instructed to continue repeating a task until a certain condition is met, for example whisking a mixture until all the lumps are gone. Python has a very similar tool called the `while` loop.

The `while` loop follows almost identical structure to the `if` statement, with an expression, `:`, and indent:

<div class="code_container" markdown="1">

```python
x = int(input("x: "))

while x > 0:
    print(f"x is {x}.")
    x = x - 1

print(f"Now {x}.")
```

```text
### Output ###
>>> x: 5
>>> x is 5.
>>> x is 4.
>>> x is 3.
>>> x is 2.
>>> x is 1.
>>> Now 0.
```

</div>

However, rather than executing the indented code only if the expression `x > 0` is `True`, the `while` loop keeps executing the indented code **as long as** the expression `x > 0` remains `True`. The above code is the same as the following trail of conditionals:

```python
x = int(input("x: "))

# Check condition
if x > 0:
    # Execute indented code
    print(f"x is {x}.")
    x = x - 1
    # Check condition
    if x > 0:
        # Execute indented code
        print(f"x is {x}.")
        x = x - 1
        # Check condition
        if x > 0:
            # Execute indented code
            print(f"x is {x}.")
            x = x - 1
            # This continues on forever...

print(f"Now {x}.")
```

In the above example we only repeat the indented block when `x > 0`, but we can repeat code forever just by using `while True`:

```python
# Include LargeMotor functionality.
from ev3dev2.motor import LargeMotor, OUTPUT_A

first_motor = LargeMotor(OUTPUT_A)

# Repeat forever
while True:
    # Go forwards at full speed
    first_motor.on_for_seconds(100, 1)
    # Go backwards at full speed
    first_motor.on_for_seconds(-100, 1)
```

<div class="note" markdown="1" title="Stopping Code" open="1">

Now we can have programs that run forever, so how do we stop them?

If you are running your programs through the command line, then you can stop them by pressing Ctrl + C.

If you are running them in EV3Sim, then you can stop them by exiting the simulation, or restarting the bot.

</div>

## Using Infrared Sensors

In the previous workshop we began working with color and ultrasonic sensors. This workshop we'll work with a very powerful and slightly more complicated sensor - The infrared sensor.

The infrared (or IR) sensor is what we use to track the ball when playing a game of soccer. It does this by looking for the ball with 5 small sensors, all pointing in slightly different directions.
So if the left sensors are more strongly sensing the ball than the right sensors, we know the ball is to the left of the robot.

To connect to the infrared sensors requires a bit more effort in our programming:

```python
from ev3dev2.sensor import Sensor, INPUT_1

# Connect to the sensor
infrared = Sensor(INPUT_1, driver_name="ht-nxt-ir-seek-v2")
# Set the mode to what we want
infrared.mode = "AC-ALL"

# Gather information
direction = infrared.value(0)
very_left = infrared.value(1)
slightly_left = infrared.value(2)
middle = infrared.value(3)
slightly_right = infrared.value(4)
very_right = infrared.value(5)

print(
    f"Direction: {direction}.",
    f"Sensor values: {very_left}, {slightly_left}, {middle}, {slightly_right}, {very_right}."
)
```

Rather than using something specific, like we did with `ColorSensor` and `UltrasonicSensor`, we instead need to use the basic `Sensor` connection, and specify a driver name.

What's worse is that rather than having useful methods like `.rgb` and `distance_centimeters`, we gather different bits of data using the `value` call.

As you can see in the code, `value(0)` is the predicted direction of the ball. This is a value from 0 to 9, with 0 meaning no signal, and 1 to 9 meaning far left to far right (with 5 meaning centered).

`value(1), value(2)` and so on then give you the specific signal strengths for the 5 smaller sensors, from left to right. These also range from 0 to 9, where 0 means no signal, and 9 means highest possible signal.

Download the task [here](ev3simc://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1M1PiRyov2JA9wU0C1Ac-Fq9XD8d6ZJYX).

Write some code so that your bot shifts to the left or right so it is directly below the red ball.

Use a while loop and the `value(0)` call to infrared sensors to repeatedly check where the ball is.

Extension: Rather than using `value(0)` to see whether the ball is to the left or right, use `value(1), value(2)...`

## Advanced Usage

`while` loops already open up a bunch of possibilities. For example, we can keep track of counters in our `while` loops to execute the indented code with different variable values:

<div class="code_container" markdown="1">

```python
x = 1

# Print x * x while it is <= 100.
while x * x <= 100:
    square = x * x
    print(f"{x}^2 = {square}")
    x = x + 1
```

```text
### Output ###
>>> 1^2 = 1
>>> 2^2 = 4
>>> 3^2 = 9
>>> 4^2 = 16
>>> 5^2 = 25
>>> 6^2 = 36
>>> 7^2 = 49
>>> 8^2 = 64
>>> 9^2 = 81
>>> 10^2 = 100
```

<div class="puzzle" markdown="1" title="Different Numbers">

Modify the above code snippet to:

* Part 1 (Easy): Print the cube numbers `x * x * x`, while `x <= 10`. (1, 8, 27, ...)

<div>
<div class="hint" key="different-num-1" title="Hint" markdown="1">
Modify `x * x <= 100` and `square = x * x`.
</div>
</div>

* Part 2 (Medium): Print every second square number less than 500. (1, 9, 25, ...)

<div>
<div class="hint" key="different-num-2" title="Hint" markdown="1">
Modify `x = x + 1` so that we print every second square.
</div>
</div>

* Part 3 (Hard): Print all powers of 2 less than 10000. (2, 4, 8, 16, ...)

<div>
<div class="hint" key="different-num-3" title="Hint" markdown="1">
Modify `x = x + 1`, so that on the `i`th time we run this indented code, x has the value 2 to the power of i.
</div>
</div>

<div class="puzzle" markdown="1" title="Higher / Lower">

A classic and simple game to play is higher / lower. You've been asked to implement this game for your friend Chantelle.

Write a program which:

* Prompts player 1 for a number
* Then repeatedly:
    * Prompts player 2 for a number
    * If player 1's number is lower than this, print 'Lower'
    * If player 1's number is higher than this, print 'Higher'
    * If this number is exactly player 1's, prints 'Success' and the program ends

Test the game with a few different values to make sure it works.

<div>

<div class="hint" key="higher-lower-1" title="Hint 1" markdown="1">If you want to repeat something until a certain condition is met, we need `while condition:`.
When should `condition` change?
</div>

<div class="hint" key="higher-lower-2" title="Hint 2" markdown="1">Create a variable, `guessed_correctly = False`, to store whether player 2 has guessed the number yet. Then you can put most of the code inside a loop that starts with `while not guessed_correctly:`

## Working with Bots

<div class="project" markdown="1" title="Memory Maze">

You find yourself trapped yet again in a maze, and the exit is locked by a passcode!

In order to escape, you need to take a particular path around the maze, according to the following rules:

Each combination of Colour Red/Green/Blue and whether you are facing a wall or not has an accompanying sequence:

| Type          | Sequence    |
| :------------ | :---------- |
| Green Wall    | RLLLLL...   |
| Red Wall      | LLRLLR...   |
| Blue Wall     | RRLLRRLL... |
| Green No Wall | FFF...      |
| Red No Wall   | LRLRLR...   |
| Blue No Wall  | FRFRFR...   |

Each of these sequences denote the direction (L=Left, R=Right, F=Forward) you should move after encountering each situation. So the first time you see a green square with a wall in front, you should move R=Right, but the next time you see it you should move L=Left, and the time after that you move L=Left, and so on and so forth.

After spawning in, you should follow these rules until you land on a white square. When this occurs, it is time to submit the passcode. The passcode is simply the path you've taken to get to the white square, so if you started on a Red square, moved to a Blue square, moved to a Red square, moved to a Green square and then ended on the White square, the passcode would be `"RBRG"`.

Your task is to modify the code in the custom task [here](ev3simc://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1NJt24aqU_PByQMtHK6kR3tkCZE3NUPjO) so that your bot can escape the maze. You can also try this challenge with physical bots!

<div>

<div class="hint" key="project-1" title="Hint 1">Store a counter for each of the 6 colour/wall combinations, and set them to 0. This will store what point you are at in each sequence of directions.</div>

<div class="hint" key="project-2" title="Hint 2">Whenever you encounter one of these combinations, you should increase the related counter. If your counter becomes too big (You reach the end of the sequence), then you should reset the counter to 0.</div>

<div class="hint" key="project-3" title="Hint 3">Every while loop, check the colour and whether there is a wall there. Let's say for example it is red and there is a wall. If our counter for this combination is 0 or 1, then we should turn left. If our counter for this combination is 2, then we should turn right. After turning either direction, we increase the counter by 1, and if the counter is equal to 3, then reset to 0. Take a similar approach for all six combinations.</div>

## Recap / What is Python?

As we were setting up Python last time, we ran some sample code and just checked that everything worked (If it didn't, make sure to go back through the previous page).

Today let's try to explain what is going on in this example and understand Python's basic concepts, giving you the skills to write similar programs yourself.

First, a bit about Python. Python code is run line by line, meaning that in the code we viewed previously, line 1 would be run, then line 2, and line 3, and so on. Much like the steps to a cooking recipe, often a program has a rather obvious flow to it. You simply complete one step, and move on to the next.

Armed with this information, let's try to unpack what Python is doing in the code from last time:

```python
my_number = 3 + 4
my_name = "Mr. Robot"
message = "You've done everything correctly!"

print("Hello from test.py!")
print(message)
print(f"Hi {my_name}. Do you like the number {my_number}?")
```

**Line 1** `my_number = 3 + 4`

We create a variable. A recipe might ask to remember something for later use (Remember how many minutes you left the cake in the oven, this will affect the resting time). Similarly, we can tell Python to remember certain data through the use of variables. A variable has a name (in this case `my_number`) which we use to look at or change what is remembered. Later on in the code, if we use this name, Python knows to replace it with the value we remembered (So `my_number + 1` is 8). To remember some value, we write `variable_name = variable_value`. In this case, we store the number 7 into `my_number`.

**Strings**

Before we continue, let's talk a tiny bit about data. Python, and many other programming languages, can answer simple questions, like:

* What's 3 plus 4?
* Is there an 'a' in the word 'giraffe'?

But to do so we need to somehow represent numbers and words in Python. For numbers, this is easy, we can just use the numbers themselves, as you saw above with `my_number = 3 + 4`. For words/messages, we need some way to tell Python that this text is not code, and is just a message. We do this by surrounding the message with quotation marks `"`.

So while `Hey python, do this!` is code, `"Hey python, do this!"` is a bit of data, called a *string*.

**Lines 2 and 3** `my_name = "Mr. Robot", message = "You've done everything correctly!"`

On line 2, we create another variable. In this example, however, the value we create is not a number; it's a string!

On line 3 we do the same thing.

**Lines 5 and 6** `print("Hello from test.py!"), print(message)`

On line 5, we use the `function` `print`. `print` allows us to print data to the screen.
Any data in between the `()` brackets gets printed to console, so `print(my_number)` would print 7.
If you want to print multiple bits of data, they need to be separated by commas (try `print(my_number, "test")`).

Line 5 just has a string in the brackets, so that string gets printed to the console (Without the quotation marks!).

Line 6 is similar, except it uses a variable. Python then replaces that variable with the value we are remembering, and prints it!

<div class="puzzle" markdown="1" title="Bug Breaking">

Alice is writing some code to print a message to the screen.
She wants the following message to be printed:

```text
Hello World!
30 + 3 = 33
```

But currently her code has two bugs (errors in programs are often called bugs). Can you spot them?

```python
my_message = Hello World!
my_number = 33

print(my_message)
print("30 + 3 = my_number")
```

<div>
<div class="hint" key="bugs-1" title="Hint 1">The first problem is on line 1. Is Alice correctly creating a message in Python?</div>
<div class="hint" key="bugs-2" title="Hint 2" markdown="1">After fixing the first problem, the code will run, but the second line printed will not be `30 + 3 = 33`. Why is this?

</div>
</div>

</div>

**Line 7** `print(f"Hi {my_name}. Do you like the number {my_number}?")`

Before the quotation marks we have an `f` on line 7, surely this is a typo!
But actually this `f` is important. It stands for *format*, and allows us to insert data into our string!
Anywhere in the string, if some text is surrounded by curly brackets (`{}`), Python will assume this is code, and run it.
So we can write `print(f"5 + 4 = {5+4}")` to get '5 + 4 = 9'!

Because we have `{my_number}` and `{my_name}` on line 7, these get replaced with `7` and `Mr. Robot`.

<div class="puzzle" markdown="1" title="Modifying the Code">

We saw that the following message was printed to the console:

```text
Hello from test.py!
You've done everything correctly!
Hi Mr. Robot. Do you like the number 7?
```

Can you modify only lines 1, 2, and 3 in the code above so that the following is printed:

```text
Hello from test.py!
You've done everything INcorrectly >:)
Hi 24. Do you like the number seven?
```

<div>
<div class="hint" key="modify-1" title="Hint 1">To change the second line of output, we need to change the message on line 3.</div>
<div class="hint" key="modify-2" title="Hint 2">To change the third line of output, we need to set `my_name` to a number (24), and `my_number` to a message `seven`. How can we do this, just as the example code does?</div>
</div>

</div>

<div class="continue"></div>

## Writing your own stuff

Python can do a lot more with variables and data than print it to a console, however. What makes programming interesting is that we can modify these values to do more interesting things. For example, we can do simple maths with numbers:

<div class="code_container" markdown="1">

```python
# Create some variables
x = 2
y = 3
print(x + y)
# The * is for multiplication.
# You can write it with Shift and 8 on the keyboard
# The # is written with Shift and 3 on the keyboard
print(x * y)
print(x / y)
# A late entrant! Variables from variables!?
z = x + y
print(z / 3)
```

```text
### Output ###
>>> 5
>>> 6
>>> 0.66666667
>>> 1.66666667
```

</div>

<div class="note" markdown="1" title="# Comments" open="1">

The greyed out lines in the code above are **comments**.

Python doesn't care about comments, they are just ignored when running code. A comment starts with the `#` symbol.

</div>

<div class="puzzle" markdown="1" title="Magic Trick">

Jacob the mathemagician wants to complete an age-old magic trick. It is completed as follows:

* Take any 3 digit number
* Multiply the number by 7
* Multiply the number by 11
* Multiply the number by 13
* The result should then be the same 3 digit number, repeated!

Jacob, however, has forgotten how to translate some of these steps into Python code, can you help him?

You can download the task [here](ev3simc://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1EqQtaNib0O2Ck7aIdGobPsrsockSI5aV).

![Example of task being completed](/assets/img/magic.gif)

<div>
<div class="hint" key="trick-1" title="Hint">The first step (multiplying by 7) has been done for you. Now create a new variable, and set it to 'times7 * 11'. Now you've done the second step.</div>
</div>
</div>

Hopefully, you can see by now that variables are quite versatile. We can use them to store values. We can even have variables  based on other variables (`z = x + y`). They are limited in one way though - their values don't change unless you change them yourself.

<div class="code_container" markdown="1">

```python
x = 2
y = 3
z = x + y
print(z)
# Here I'll update y. It won't affect the value of z however.
y = 5
# So x+y = 7 now
print(z, x+y)
```

```text
### Output ###
>>> 5
>>> 5 7
```

</div>

This is because of the way variables are created. When you write something like `z = x + y`, The following happens:

* First the right hand side of the `=` sign is looked at. This means that the `x` becomes `2`, the `y` becomes `3`, because of the data these variables contain, and so `x + y` becomes `5`.
* The right hand side value is then stored in the left hand side variable. So `5` is stored in `z`.

Additionally, the left hand side can only be one variable name, you can't have `x=3`, `y=2` and then set `x+y=z`. You need to move it around so that `z` is by itself on the left hand side.

This can seem rather restrictive, but there's more fun stuff we can do because of this restriction:

<div class="code_container" markdown="1">

```python
variable = 1
variable = variable + 1
print(variable)
variable = variable * variable * variable
print(variable)
```

```text
### Output ###
>>> 2
>>> 8
```

</div>

Let's see why this works by analysing the second line, `variable = variable + 1`:

* First the right hand side of the `=` sign is looked at. This means that `variable` becomes `1`, and so `variable + 1` becomes `2`.
* `2` is stored in `variable` (from the left hand side).

So a variable can change itself!

## Controlling Motors

Now that we've got some of the basics down pat, we can start controlling the robots.

<div style="width: 100%; overflow: auto;" markdown="1">
<div style="width: 40%; margin-top: 32px; float: left;" markdown="1">
<p>
We'll take the bot you've already created and add some motors to it. You can do this by pressing the pencil icon on the bot menu, and selecting the device button (White square with red circle) from the left hand sidebar.
</p>
<p markdown="1">
When you place the motors, you need to select a `port` field. Set the motor `port` fields to `outA` and `outB` for two different LargeMotors. This will allow us to connect to these LargeMotors in our code.
</p>
</div>
<div style="width: 60%; padding-left: 5%; padding-bottom: 32px; float: left; ">
<video width="100%" controls>
    <source src="/assets/video/add_motors.mp4">
    Your browser does not support video playback.
</video>
</div>
</div>

Next, we'll start writing code to control the motors. Here's a simple script that will turn one motor forward for 1 second, and then reverse the motor for 1 second.

```python
# Include LargeMotor functionality.
from ev3dev2.motor import LargeMotor, OUTPUT_A, OUTPUT_B

# Connect to the large motor on port outA
first_motor = LargeMotor(OUTPUT_A)

# Go forwards at full speed
first_motor.on_for_seconds(100, 1)
# Go backwards at full speed
first_motor.on_for_seconds(-100, 1)
```

The first line `imports` functions that we can use in our code. Just like `print` is a keyword we can use to run some command (sending data to the screen), importing allows us to add more keywords which reference other commands (In this case connecting to motors).

To then send commands to the LargeMotor, we have to connect to the device, and then store this connection in a variable, as line 5 does. `OUTPUT_A` corresponds to the `port` `outA` we selected before (We can use keyword `OUTPUT_A` here because we imported it on line 2).

After this, we can send commands to the motor through the variable we created.
`my_motor.on_for_seconds(x, y)` then turns the motor on for `y` seconds at `x` speed (`x` can be anything from -100 to 100, and `y` must be positive). If you start the simulator, this code should move the robot forwards then backwards.

<div class="note" title="Blocking operations" open="1" markdown="1">

Notice how in the example code above, the motor moves forwards, and then back, separately. This is because `on_for_seconds` is a *blocking* operation. This means that the code will not keep running until the motor has run for that many seconds.

If instead we wanted the operation to not block our code from running (like when we want to run two motors at once), you need to use the following code:

```python
from ev3dev2.motor import LargeMotor, OUTPUT_A, OUTPUT_B

first_motor = LargeMotor(OUTPUT_A)
second_motor = LargeMotor(OUTPUT_B)

# This first command won't block.
first_motor.on_for_seconds(100, 1, block=False)
# This second command will block.
second_motor.on_for_seconds(-100, 1)
```

</div>

<div class="puzzle" markdown="1" title="Square Dance">

Now using these skills, let's write some code to move around the field in a square pattern, hitting all 4 locations.

You can download the task [here](ev3simc://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1oBxGOzqUwD-R3_2Gs2X0V9C9DECMsmEH).

Pressing the Bot button will allow you to edit the bot, and add motors.
Pressing the Code button will allow you to edit the code the bot will run, controlling the motors.

Here's an example of what you need to make the bot do (With the motors invisible, so you can't see what the solution is):

![Example of task being completed](/assets/img/square.gif)

<div>
<div class="hint" key="square-1" title="Hint 1">If you place the motors like is shown in the video, then to move forward both motors need to be turned on at the same speeds. How can we do this in Python?</div>
<div class="hint" key="square-2" title="Hint 2">To rotate, one motor should move forward, will the other pushes back. This causes one half of the robot to try moving forward, while the other reverses, resulting in the robot rotating on the spot.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="continue"></div>

## Getting user input

Another thing that Python can do is ask for data while we are running the code. We do this with the `input` function.

Try running the following code:

```python
name = input("What's your name?")
print(f"Hello {name}!")
```

When running this code in the simulator, a box should appear below the console. Type your name and then press enter. You should then get the personalised message printed with your name!

The data in the `()` brackets of input will first be printed to console as a prompt. Then, once you enter your name (or any other data), and press enter, the string (remember: message) of that data is stored in variable `name`.

So if you entered `Chris` as your name, the code would do the same thing as

```python
name = "Chris"
print(f"Hello {name}!")
```

Because this `input` is always a string however, we need to change this slightly to supply our program with numbers.
Python has a function `int` which converts any string into an Integer (Whole number). So `int("4")` is the number 4 in Python.

Using this `int` function, we can convert our `input` into a number:

```python
my_number = int(input("How many programs have you written?"))
print(f"I've written {my_number + 1} :p")
```

<div class="puzzle" markdown="1" title="Buggy code">

Serena is helping design metal sheets for a construction company. For a metal sheet of length `l` and width `w`, Serena wants to know the following:

* What the area of the sheet is
* If she doubled the length of the sheet, what the perimeter would be

Serena knows the cost of a metal sheet is the sum of these two values, so she prints this at the end of her code.
Her code currently has some 3 bugs (errors) that need fixing. Can you find and fix them?

## Checkpoint Task

Now that we can control motors, print information and store information in variables, let's combine this into one big project!

<div class="project" markdown="1" title="Search and Destroy">

Download the task [here](ev3simc://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1FyfO4RyzXfEsUmgRQdCKoYDDRh59JqZT).

Your are a sentry robot, positioned on a grid.

Your objective is to move to a purple flag, which also spawns on the grid.

Positions on this grid are coordinates, just like on a graph, where a positive `y` coordinate moves up the grid, while a positive `x` coordinate moves right across the grid.

You always spawn at x=`-50`, y=`35`, but the spawn position of the flag is random (But always to the right and below you). Luckily you know what these coordinates are, so you can use this information to ambush the flag. The small grey dot in the centre is at x=`0`, y=`0`.

The first call to `input` in your program will receive the `x` coordinate of the flag, and the second call to `input` in your program will receive the `y` coordinate of the flag.

Modify the code, and add motors to your robot so that it can ambush the flag!

Here's an example solution, with the motors hidden:

![Example of project being completed](/assets/img/search_destroy.gif)

<div>
<div class="hint" key="project-1" title="Hint 1" markdown="1">Provided you completed the "Square Dance" puzzle, you can reuse the first two steps (move right, move down). All that needs to be modified is how long we turn the motors on for... Try moving to the grey dot first, this can help you do some calculations.
</div>
<div class="hint" key="project-2" title="Hint 2" markdown="1">If you can get to the grey dot, we know how long it takes to move 50 units, and how long it takes to move 35 units. Using either of these times, you can figure out how long it takes to move 1 unit. Now if we want to move `R` units for some number `R`, we just need to multiply the time to travel 1 unit by `R` to get the time to travel `R` units.
</div>
<div class="hint" key="project-3" title="Hint 3" markdown="1">If the flag is at `x=flag_x`, and `y=flag_y`, then the distance between us and the flag should be `50 + flag_x` horizontally and `35 - flag_y` vertically. This should be all the information we need to travel to the flag.
</div>
</div>
</div>

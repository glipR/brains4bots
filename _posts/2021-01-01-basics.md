## Recap / What is Python?

In the last section of last week's workshop, we ran some sample code on your robot and just checked that everything worked (If it didn't, try to fix this first or see one of the mentors).

Today we'll try to explain what is going on in this example and understand Python's basic concepts, giving you the skills to write similar programs yourself.

First, a bit about Python. Python code is run line by line, meaning that in the file we viewed previously, line 1 would be run, then line 2, and line 3, and so on. Often, a program has a rather obvious flow to it, much like the steps to a recipe, you simply complete one step, and move on to the next. We'll try to use this metaphor often.

Armed with this information, let's try to unpack what Python is doing in the program from last workshop:

```python
my_number = 3
my_name = "Mr. Robot"
message = "You've done everything correctly!"

print("Hello from test.py!")
print(message)
print(f"Hi {my_name}. Do you like the number {my_number}?")
```

**Line 1** `my_number = 3`

We initialise a variable. A recipe might ask to remember something for later use (Remember how many minutes you left the cake in the oven, this will affect the resting time). Similarly, we can tell Python to remember certain data through the use of variables. A variable has a name (in this case `my_number`) which we use to access or change what is remembered. Later on in the code, if we use this name, Python knows to replace it with the value we remembered (So `my_number + 1` is 4). To remember some value, we write `variable_name = variable_value`. In this case, we store the number 3 into `my_number`.

**Lines 2 and 3** `my_name = "...", message = "..."`

On line 2, we initialise another variable. In this example, however, the value we initialise is not a number; quotations surround some words. This is called a `string`, and it is how Python denotes text data. The reason we need quotation marks is so that Python can tell the difference between code (Like the variable `my_number`) and text data (the word `"my_number"`).

On line 3 we do the same thing.

**Lines 5 and 6** `print("..."), print(message)`

On line 5, we then call the `function` `print`. `print` allows us to print data to the console.
Any data in between the `()` brackets gets printed to console, so `print(my_number)` would print 3.
If you want to print multiple bits of data, they need to be separated by characters (try `print(my_number, "test")`).

Line 5 just has a string in the brackets, so that string gets printed to the console (Without the quotation marks!).

Line 6 is similar, except it uses a variable. Python then replaces that variable with the value we are remembering, and prints it!

**Line 7** `print(f"Hi {my_name}. Do you like the number {my_number}?")`

Before the quotation marks we have an `f` on line 7, surely this is a typo!
But actually this `f` is important. It stands for *format*, and allows us to insert values into our string!
Anywhere in the string, if some text is surrounded by `{}` brackets, Python will assume this is code, and evaluate it.
So we can write `print(f"5 + 4 = {5+4}")` to get '5 + 4 = 9'!

Because we have `{my_number}` and `{my_name}` on line 7, these get replaced with `3` and `Mr. Robot`.
What happens when we remove the `f` from this example?

<div class="puzzle" markdown="1" title="Modifying the Code">

We saw that the following message was printed to the console:

```text
Hello from test.py!
You've done everything correctly!
Hi Mr. Robot. Do you like the number 3?
```

Can you modify the code above so that the following is printed:

```text
Hello from test.py!
You've done everything INcorrectly >:)
Hi 24. Do you like the number three?
```

<div class="continue"></div>

## Writing your own stuff

Python can do a lot more with variables and data than print it to a console, however. What makes programming interesting is that we can modify these values to do more interesting things. For example, we can do simple maths with numbers:

```python
x = 2
y = 3
print(x + y)
print(x * y)
print(x / y)
print(x - y)
print(x + y / 3)
z = x + y
print(z / 3)
### Output ###
# >>> 5
# >>> 6
# >>> 0.66666667
# >>> -1
# >>> 3.0
# >>> 1.66666667
```

<div class="note" markdown="1" title="# Comments" open="1">

The greyed out lines in the code snippet above are **comments**.

Python doesn't care about comments, they are just ignored when running code. A comment starts with the `#` symbol.

</div>

<div class="puzzle" markdown="1" title="Magic Trick">

Jacob the magician wants to complete an age-old magic trick. It is completed as follows:

* Take any 3 digit number
* Multiply the number by 7
* Multiply the number by 11
* Multiply the number by 13
* The result should then be the same 3 digit number, repeated!

Jacob, however, has forgotten how to translate some of these steps into Python code. He has the following scaffold, and is asking you to complete it:

```python
# repeated number trick, by Jacob the magician.
# The users number goes here
my_number = 632

# TODO: FILL IN THIS CODE? WHAT WENT HERE AGAIN?
# ========================================

first_multiplication = my_number * 7

answer = 0  # TODO: Replace this with the actual end result
# ========================================

print(f"Lo and behold, your answer must be {answer}! And you started with {my_number}!?")
```
<div>
<div class="hint" key="trick-1" title="Hint">The first step (multiplying by 7) has been done for you. Now create a new variable, and set it to 'first_multiplication * 11'. Now you've done the second step.</div>
</div>
</div>

Hopefully, you can see by now that variables are quite versatile. We can use them to store values. We can even have variable definitions based on other variables (`z = x + y`). They are limited in one way though - their values don't change unless you change them yourself.

```python
x = 2
y = 3
z = x + y
print(z)
# Here I'll update y. It won't affect the value of z however.
y = 5
print(z)
### Output ###
# >>> 5
# >>> 5
```

This is because of the way variables are assigned. When you write something like `z = x + y`, The following happens:

* First the right hand side of the `=` sign is evaluated. This means that `x` is evaluated to `2`, `y` is evaluated to `3`, because of the data these variables contain, and so `x + y` evaluates to `5`.
* The evaluation of the right hand side is then stored in the left hand side. So `5` is stored in `z`.

Additionally, the left hand side can only be one variable name, you can't have `x=3`, `y=2` and then set `x+y=z`. You need to move it around so that `z` is by itself on the left hand side.

This can seem rather restrictive, but there's more fun stuff we can do because of this restriction:

```python
variable = 1
variable = variable + 1
print(variable)
variable = variable * variable * variable
print(variable)
### Output ###
# >>> 2
# >>> 8
```

Let's see why this works by analysing the second line, `variable = variable + 1`:

* First the right hand side of the `=` sign is evaluated. This means that `variable` is evaluated to `1`, and so `variable + 1` evaluates to `2`.
* `2` is stored in `variable` (from the left hand side).

So a variable can change itself!

## Getting user input

Another thing that Python can do is ask for data while we are running the code. We do this with the `input` function.

Try running the following code:

```python
x = input("What's your name?")
print(f"Hello {x}!")
```

When running in the simulator, a white box should appear in console. Type your name and then press enter. You should then get the personalised message printed with your name!

The data in the `()` brackets of input will first be printed to console as a prompt. Then, once you enter your name (or any other data), and press enter, the string of that data replaces input.

So if you entered `Chris` as your name, the code would do the same thing as

```python
x = "Chris"
print(f"Hello {x}!")
```

Because this `input` is always a string however, we need to change this slightly to supply our program with numbers.
Python has a function `int` which converts any string into an Integer (Whole number). So `int("4")` is the number 4 in Python.

Using this `int` function, we can convert our `input` into a number:

```python
my_number = int(input("How many programs have you written?"))
print(f"I've written {my_number + 1} :p")
```

<div class="puzzle" markdown="1" title="Requesting a number">
Change your solution to Jacob's magic trick to set `my_number` from user input, like in the examples above, and make sure the code still works.

<div class="puzzle" markdown="1" title="Buggy code">

Serena is helping design metal sheets for a construction company. For a metal sheet of length `l` and width `w`, Serena wants to know the following:

* What the area of the sheet is
* If she doubled the length of the sheet, what the perimeter would be

Serena knows the cost of a metal sheet is the sum of these two values, so she prints this at the end of her code.
Her code currently has some 2 bugs (errors) that need fixing. Can you find and fix them?

```python
# Serena's metal sheet construction code.
l = int(input("What is l: "))
w = int(input("and w: "))

# Double the length
w = l * 2

# Get the perimeter of this doubled sheet
perimeter = 2 * w + 2 * l

# Get the area
area = w * l

# Print the sum
# This should be 52=24+28 with the l=4 and w=6 :(
print(area + perimeter)
```

<div>

<div class="hint" key="serena-1" title="Hint" markdown="1">The easiest way to analyse code is by printing variables when you can. Try printing `area` and `perimeter`. Do they have values you expect?

## Controlling Motors

Now that we've got some of the basics down pat, we can start controlling the robots.

<div style="width: 100%; overflow: auto;" markdown="1">
<div style="width: 40%; margin-top: 32px; float: left;" markdown="1">
<p>
First, add some Large Motors to your testing bot. You can do this by pressing the pencil icon on the bot menu, and selecting the device button (White square with red circle) from the left hand sidebar.
</p>
<p markdown="1">
When you place the motors, you need to select a `port` field. Set the motor `port` fields to `outA` and `outB` for two different LargeMotors. This will allow us to connect to these LargeMotors in our code.
</p>
</div>
<div style="width: 60%; padding-left: 5%; padding-bottom: 32px; float: left; ">
<video width="100%" controls>
    <source src="/assets/video/add_motors.mp4">
    Your browser does not support video playback.
</video>
</div>
</div>

Next, we'll start writing code to control the motors. Here's a simple script that will turn one motor for 1 second, and then reverse the motor for 1 second.

```python
# Include LargeMotor functionality.
from ev3dev2.motor import LargeMotor, OUTPUT_A, OUTPUT_B

first_motor = LargeMotor(OUTPUT_A)

# Go forwards at full speed
first_motor.on_for_seconds(100, 1)
# Go backwards at full speed
first_motor.on_for_seconds(-100, 1)
```

The first line `imports` functions that we can use in our code. Just like `print` is a keyword we can use to run some command (sending information to the console), importing allows us to add more keywords which reference other commands (In this case connecting to motors).

To then send commands to the LargeMotor, we have to connect to the device, and then store this connection in a variable, as line 4 does. `OUTPUT_A` corresponds to the `port` `outA` we selected before (We can use `OUTPUT_A` here because we imported it on line 2).

After this, we can send commands to the motor through the variable we created.
`my_motor.on_for_seconds(x, y)` then turns the motor on for `y` seconds at `x` speed (`x` can be anything from -100 to 100, and `y` must be positive). If you start the sim, this code should move the robot forwards then backwards.

<div class="puzzle" markdown="1" title="Square Dance">

Add two motors to your bot, and modify the above code so that your bot moves in a square pattern.

<div>
<div class="hint" key="square-1" title="Hint">You can use the motor placement from the video above for this to work. One motor controls left/right movement and the other controls up/down.</div>
</div>
</div>

## Checkpoint Task

Now that we can control motors, print information and store information in variables, let's combine this into one big project!

<div class="project" markdown="1" title="Search and Destroy">

Download the task [here](ev3simc://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1FyfO4RyzXfEsUmgRQdCKoYDDRh59JqZT), and press the folder icon to get coding!

Your are a sentry robot, positioned on a grid.

Your objective is to move to a green dot, which also spawns on the grid.

Positions on this grid are referenced by coordinates, just like on a graph, where a positive `y` coordinate moves up the grid, while a positive `x` coordinate moves right across the grid.

You always spawn at x=`-50`, y=`35`, but the spawn position of the green dot is random (But always to the right and below you). Luckily you know what these coordinates are, so you can use this information to ambush the green dot. The small grey dot in the centre is at x=`0`, y=`0`.

The first call to `input` in your program will receive the `x` coordinate of the green dot, and the second call to `input` in your program will receive the `y` coordinate of the green dot.

Modify the code in `code.py` so your robot ambushes the green dot!

![Example of project being completed](/assets/img/search_destroy.gif)

<div>
<div class="hint" key="project-1" title="Hint 1">Try changing 'a' and 'b' in 'horizontalMotor.on_for_seconds(100, a)' and 'verticalMotor.on_for_seconds(100, b)' so that your robot lands on the grey dot in the centre. You can then use 'a' or 'b' to calculate the speed of your robot, in units/second!</div>
<div class="hint" key="project-2" title="Hint 2">You should find that a=1.9 and b=1.33 (or close to this). Using this, we can calculate the speed of the robot is approximately 50 / 1.9 = 26.316 units/second. Now, if we can just figure out how far we need to move in 'x' and 'y' directions, we can use this to calculate the amount of seconds each motor should be on for...</div>

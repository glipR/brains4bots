On this page we'll install EV3Sim and VSCode, our 2 main tools for writing programs.

## Why EV3Sim?

Python and programming can be very powerful tools, but a lot of the most basic tools you can use are a bit bland.
Most beginner python programs are simple things like printing messages to the screen, or doing some maths.

EV3Sim allows you to use those basic Python programs to solve puzzles, and create robots:

So even if you plan to use a real life EV3 Robot for these workshops, installing EV3Sim is worthwhile.

## Installing EV3Sim

Installing EV3Sim is *suuuper* simple, if you are on windows.

### Windows

Click [here](https://github.com/MelbourneHighSchoolRobotics/ev3sim/releases) and download `installer.exe`, then run the file.

If an antivirus of some kind pops up, you can safely ignore the warnings and continue.

Then just follow that prompts and go make yourself a drink while EV3Sim installs.

And that's it! EV3Sim should now show up in your Start Menu, at the bottom left:

### Mac / Linux / Potato

Installing on any other operating system is currently a bit of a pain since we need to install Python separately.

First install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and while installing make sure to click "Add Python to PATH".

You can ensure this has worked by opening Terminal, and then typing `python` and pressing enter. The result should look like this:

You'll need Python 3.9 or higher for ev3sim however. After this, close and reopen a new Terminal. Then, to install ev3sim, type out `python -m pip install ev3sim`, and press enter.

Now, if you type `ev3sim` in the Terminal, and press enter, it should open ev3sim.

## Start Coding

First, let's open EV3Sim and get an idea of what we can do.
